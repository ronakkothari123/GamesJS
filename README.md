As the instructions on how to play the game aren't listed on the website (as the website's purpose is to showcase the game), the instructions will be listed here
* Pong is a two-player electronic sports game that simulates table tennis.
* The game consists of a rectangular playing field or "court" divided into two halves by a vertical line.
* Each player controls a paddle, which can move vertically within their respective half of the court.
* The game's objective is to score points by maneuvering the paddle to hit a small ball back and forth over the net.
* The ball initially starts in the center of the court and moves horizontally, bouncing off the top and bottom walls and the paddles.
* The players take turns hitting the ball, attempting to make it pass the opponent's paddle, and touch the wall behind it.
* When a player fails to return the ball, the opponent scores a point, and the game continues with a new round.
* Players can control the movement of their paddles using arrow keys for the right player and WASD for the left player.
* The game ends when one player reaches 11 points or when one player decides to resign.
## How to Use 
As this program was designed to serve as inspiration, feel free to fork this repository and edit it to suit your needs. The base game of Pong is already hard coded and all the mathematical operations and rendering functions have been created. Forking the repository and performing minor adjustments is what this base layer is for.
